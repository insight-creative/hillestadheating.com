## Why Indoor Air Quality Matters

The EPA reports that indoor air can be 2–5 times more polluted than outdoor air. That’s because your home traps airborne particles, moisture and contaminants, especially when it's sealed tight for energy efficiency.

Common IAQ concerns include:

* Dust, pet dander and pollen

* Mold and mildew from excess humidity 

* Smoke, cooking and chemical fumes (VOCs)

* Bacteria, viruses and airborne pathogens

* Poor ventilation and stale air

These pollutants don’t just irritate allergies, they can worsen asthma, lower sleep quality and increase the risk of illness.
