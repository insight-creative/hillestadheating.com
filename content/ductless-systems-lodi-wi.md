## Efficient, Zoned Comfort Without the Ductwork

Looking for flexible, energy-efficient cooling or heating, without the hassle of ductwork? A ductless mini-split system might be the perfect solution. At Hillestad Heating and Cooling Systems, we install and service high-quality ductless systems that give you precise temperature control room by room.

Whether you're upgrading a single room, finishing a basement or replacing old electric baseboards, our experienced team will help you find the right ductless setup for your home.

## What Is a Ductless Mini-Split?

A ductless system, also called a mini-split, is a type of heating and cooling system that doesn't rely on traditional air ducts. It consists of two main parts:

*	An outdoor compressor unit

*	One or more indoor wall-mounted air handlers

Each air handler controls the temperature of an individual room or “zone,” allowing you to heat or cool specific spaces more efficiently.
