## What Is a Ductless Mini-Split?

A ductless system, also called a mini-split, is a type of heating and cooling system that doesn't rely on traditional air ducts. It consists of two main parts:

*	An outdoor compressor unit

*	One or more indoor wall-mounted air handlers

Each air handler controls the temperature of an individual room or “zone,” allowing you to heat or cool specific spaces more efficiently.

## Ideal Uses for Ductless Systems

Ductless systems are perfect for:

*	Homes without existing ductwork

*	Bonus rooms, garages and basements

*	Sunrooms and home additions

*	Zoned comfort in multi-story homes

*	Replacing outdated window or wall units

*	Energy-efficient upgrades in older homes

They’re also a great fit for families with different temperature preferences in different rooms.
