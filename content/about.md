## Built on Hard Work. Powered by Trust.

Hillestad Heating and Cooling Systems started in 1988 with five hardworking HVAC professionals and one big idea: to deliver reliable, honest heating and cooling service with a personal touch. With diverse expertise across all areas of HVAC, the team came together and slowly built a business from the ground up.

For the first year, the company operated out of personal vans and garages, with Terry Hillestad’s garage serving as the main shop. As word spread and the work kept coming, the team opened their first official office in downtown Lodi, in the basement of a dental office.

By 1991, Hillestad had purchased land in Lodi’s industrial park to build a dedicated office and sheet metal shop. From there, the company continued to expand, constructing additional buildings, repurposing rental space and adapting as growth 
demanded. The sheet metal shop alone has relocated three times to accommodate increasing demand.

Today, Hillestad is proud to be a trusted name in south-central Wisconsin for heating, cooling, refrigeration and indoor air quality services. We’ve never forgotten where we came from, and we carry that same spirit of commitment, craftsmanship and care into every job we do.

## Our Philosophy

Our team is well-trained and experienced in all areas of HVAC, including servicing existing equipment, installing new systems, replacing old units and providing routine maintenance.
